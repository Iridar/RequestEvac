[h1]Description[/h1]

This mod could have been renamed Firebrand Choice 🤔
The ability to place the evac zone has been modified. No longer will you be able to place the evac zone wherever you want. No longer will it appear immediately either.
You will now request an evac, then Firebrand will place the evac zone when she is ready.

[h1]Changes[/h1]

By default Firebrand will need at least 2 turns to find a location for evac. One turn before appearing a flare will let you know the location of the evac zone.
If we find no spot, the evac zone will spawn on the squad location.
The evac zone will remain active for 3 turns.

All can be changed in the config folder in [u]XComRequestEvac.ini[/u]

[h1]Credits[/h1]

Thanks to Maluco Marinero and his Delayed Evac mod from where I took most of the code regarding delaying the time for the evac to spawn.
Thanks to Astral Descend for his help on finding how the missions handled evac spawn.
